# Kudos-box
Source code of  [kudos-box.com](http://kudos-box.com)

AAt work, we had a cardboard box where we could leave anonymous notes to praise other colleagues. It was called the Kudos Box, and that was the origin of the idea for this project.

I tried to find a digital alternative to it, but since I couldn‚Äôt find anything suitable, I decided to create it myself.
Well, I probably just wanted to write some code, and that was a good excuse for me to do it üòÖ.

Features:
- create anonymous messages in a box 
- only members of a box are able to see the messages
