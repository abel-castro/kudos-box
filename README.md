# Kudos-box
Source code of  [kudos-box.com](http://kudos-box.com)

At work we have a cardboard box in which we can leave notes anonymously 
to praise other colleagues. It is called Kudos-box and it is and the origin.
of this project. 

I tried to look for a digital alternative to it and since I couldn't find anything, 
I decided to create it myself.

Well, I probably want to write some code and I was looking for an excuse to do it 😅.

Features:
- create anonymous messages in a box 
- only members of a box are able to see the messages
